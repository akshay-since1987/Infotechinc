                JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Numbers can be written with, or without decimals
            </p> -->

                age:50, 
                eyeColor:"blue"

                In Javascript, Any type of "Number" is just a number. There's no Integer, Decimal, Float, BigInt, SmallInt, etc in Javascript.
                <code>
var x = 10;
var y = 0.2;
var z = Infinity;
var a = 2 / 0; // == Infinity
                </code>
            </p>

            <h3 id="string">Strings</h3>
            <p>
                Javascript "char" is a String. There's no Character datatype in JS. Also, String can be denoted by Single Quote ('') or Double Quote ("") in JS. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Strings are immutable. You cannot change a character within a string with something like var myString = "abbdef"; myString[2] = 'c'. The string manipulation methods such as trim, slice return new strings.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the same way, if you have two references to the same string, modifying one doesn't affect the other
            </p>
            <p>
                So all that said, Strings are assigned by reference, not by value.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may use single or double Quotes for strings but as a standard, developers prefer using one notation tending towards use of Double Quotes
                <code>
var a = 'char';                                 // "char" is a String
var b = 'c';                                    // "c" is a String
var c = "String";                               // "String" is a String
var d = "S";                                    // "S" is a String
var e = 's' + "tring";                          // "string" is a String
var f = ['s', 't', 'r',"i",'n','g'].join();     // "string" is a String
                </code>
            </p>
